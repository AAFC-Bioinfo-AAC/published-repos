## ABOUT

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location of where to find the repositories that are available in the code catalogue. As the catalogue grows, this can be used as a simpler method of finding what you need; as well as largely eliminating the responsibility of following a standard of repository naming.

### Guideline Repositories
| **Name** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------------- |
| [AAFC Bioinformatics Code Catalogue](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinformatics/ABCC_RCBA_Guide) | Contains guidelines to follow and how to contribute |
| [AAFC Pipeline Templates](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinformatics/ABCC_RCBA_Pipeline_Template) | Contains templates to follow in order to maintain consistent documentation |

### Tool Repositories
| **Name** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------------- |
| [Bacterial RNA-Seq](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinformatics/bacterial_rnaseq) | Takes reference genome and FASTQ files, quantifies reads to genome features | 
| [Genotyping by Sequencing - Snakemake](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinformatics/gbs_snakemake) | Takes reference genome and FASTQ files, quantifies variants |
| [Metagenomics - Nextflow](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinformatics/metagenomic_nf) | Automates many metagenomic analyses |
| [Nanopore Tools for GPSC](https://github.com/AAFC-Bioinformatics/nanopore_tools) | Adapts variety of nanopore tools for use on GPSC |
